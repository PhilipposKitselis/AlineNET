# AlineNet
This is a C# port of G. Kondrak's ALINE phonetic alignment algorithm. The algorithm is used for phonetic alignment of strings, a popular method used in linguistics. Please spend some time reading G. Kodrak's paper here: https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~kondrak/papers/thesis.pdf

The code provided is basically a quick port from the C++ code. I haven't done any serious refactoring. When I get some more time and better understanding of the algorithm as a whole, I will rewrite it in a proper C# fashion. Since the original C++ code was not at that time available for downloading, the https://github.com/cran/alineR project was used as a basis.
